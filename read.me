# Neutral colours
Neutral colours are the foundation for the visual language that defines the overall tone of your application. It could be fully desaturated, slightly colder or warmer, or even tinted in a fancy way to support the brand.

## Fill colours
Fills are the lightest shades in your arsenal and should be used as the main background colours.

## Stroke colours
Strokes are not supposed to fill large areas but outline or divide them.

## Alt colours
Alt or alternative colours are semi-transparent ones and could be applied both as fills and strokes.
